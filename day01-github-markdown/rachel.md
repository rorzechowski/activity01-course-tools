# Summer Semester

## Week 1

> Much like the oppossum, the wild Rachel's internal dialogue laments the impending summer schedule. 
> Between taking two classes, working 40 hr/wk (including mentoring an undergraduate intern), co-authoring a manuscript, 
> planning two weddings (one her own, the other for her best friend), and trying to keep a fiance, 3-year old cattle dog, and 8-year old guinea pig alive, 
> the wild Rachel's schedule is quite full at the moment- very much unlike her bank account.

## Knowledge Sharing

*Preferred Method of Tracking Task Completion:*

1. Create links to each reading assignment for the week in the portfolio. 
   * Each reading assignment would have its own summary with additional thoughts regarding the reading.
2. Tasks which involve a demonstration of coding ability will be given a separate link. 
   * The coding task in question will have a breakdown of the code in blocks, followed by any relevant outputs.
